## Overview

This blog preview card was challenging because I had to use a lot of flexbox on the elements.

## My process

1. Initialized project as a public repository 
2. Configured repository to publish your code to a web address. 
3. Looked through the designs to started planning. 
4. Wrote HTML first then added CSS.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Started adding styles to the top of the page and worked down. Jumped back and forth for a while.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I learned that i could use two divs then use flexbox on those two divs to align them.

For the below code snippet I was trying to get the abstract image to resize according to the container its in. I realized that using max-width at 100% would acheive this and I didnt need to add a width and height mostly becuase the width and heigh is already given.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.abstract-image {
    
    border-radius: 10px;
    border: none;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    max-width: 100%;
}

```

### Continued development

I am not confident in using css flexbox
I am not confident in matching original size of the design
